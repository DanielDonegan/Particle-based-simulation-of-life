# Particle-based-simulation-of-life
Made in Unity. A simulation software which attempts to mimic the behaviors of real-world micro-organisms

Devloped this when I was 16 / 17 as part of my computer science A-level project.
The aim of this program is to try and simulate the behaviours of micro-organisms by using basic principles of motion. Each particle will effectively have force enacted upon it by other particles
when they are in range. That force can either be attractive or repulsive, this depends on what variation of particle that this particle is. To tell particle variations apart they are represented
with their respective colours. Different variations enact greater and smaller vectors of force on one another, each quantity force enacted is respective to the exact pair of variations interacting.

The result of this is particles moving in patterns. This by itself cannot simulate micro-organisms but if you tweak the parameters for the amount of particle variations and their forces right you
can develop quite a similar behaviour from the patterns of particles. I believe there should be a few saved presets for micro-organism-esque if you look up the saved files in the prject as there
is an option to save that run of the simulation.

Feel free to experiment with the software and save your own simulations too!
