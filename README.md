# Particle-based-simulation-of-life
Made in Unity. A simulation software which attempts to mimic the behaviors of real-world micro-organisms

Devloped this when I was 16 / 17 so the code is very spaghetti-esque and there are straight up logiic flaws and unfinished pieces of UI in places. But currently I'm looking back on it and slowly getting the project to a reasonably presentable state. I must say that this probably wont be possible in the near future. Sorry
